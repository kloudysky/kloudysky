#### Hi!

# I'm Adam

### I'm a full-stack software engineer

##### Much like breathing, coding has become a salient part of my life

##### I have a strong desire to learn everything coding related, but I'm humbled by the amount I can learn and retain

##### and so I've decided to focus on mastering JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, and SQL

```javascript
while (noSuccess) {
  tryAgain();

  if (dead) break;
}
```
